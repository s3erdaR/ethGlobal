  **Decentralized Autonomous TV (DATV)**

-What is DATV?

Today on TV we cannot chose what to watch but imagine that people chose what they want to watch on TV. This projects aims to create a DAO that members can vote for a specific movie they want to watch. We call it Decentralized autonomous Television (DATV). Because like DAO's the members decide what they want to do. Idea is users choose what they want to watch with their equal voting power in IMDB Top 100 list. DAO creates a proposal autonomously and users begin to vote. After a while voting ends and proposal is being executed. Users can watch movie on the webpage.
